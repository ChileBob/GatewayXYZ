Firstly, my apologies for this really ugly code... I was young(er), the things I did seemed a good idea at the time, some of it worked out.

This kinda works, it gets called by the 'walletnotify' event from a Zcash or Ycash node and relays encrypted memos via email, twitter, reddit, or between the Zcash & Ycash networks.

Have fun, use at your own risk, in addition to the normal 'bad things' that could result from using this code remember it could cause :-

- poor cellphone reception
- global warming
- excessive adverts for cheap car insurance on cable TV
